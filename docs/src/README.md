## What's New ✨
While the original [Big Dipper](https://github.com/forbole/big-dipper) was a fullstack application, we have decided to break down the components making it easier for users to use different indexers/ databases while keeping the same UI. In this documentation we will be focusing on how to setup the UI part of Big Dipper 2.0.
