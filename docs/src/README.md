## Overview
Big Dipper is an open-source block explorer and token management tool serving over 10 proof-of-stake blockchains. It has been forked more than 100 times on GitHub and has served audiences from 140 countries and regions.

Visit [Big Dipper](https://bigdipper.live/) to see a complete list of chains.

## What's New âœ¨
While the original [Big Dipper](https://github.com/forbole/big-dipper) was a fullstack application, we have decided to break down the components making it easier for users to use different indexers/ databases while keeping the same UI. In this documentation we will be focusing on how to setup the UI part of Big Dipper 2.0.
